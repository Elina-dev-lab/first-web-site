    <h2>Elphaba</h2>
    <p>As Winnie Holzman observed in an interview with Playbill, "It was Maguire's brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops - and really the whole plot - is different onstage."[1] Schwartz justified the deviation, saying "Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda who becomes Glinda and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies."[2] In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as a scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, and Doctor Dillamond not being murdered.[3]</p>
